ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Grace! 

ðŸŽ“ Junior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, studying Mathematical Science and Data Science

ðŸ”­ I am passionate to pursue a career in DS and AI

I love tackling real-world problems through data analysis and predictive modeling. Iâ€™m big on continuously learning and building my skills, and believe taking initiative is a key to growth. Currently, I'm focusing on building machine learning models and diving deeper into data science. Iâ€™m looking to leverage and grow my skills in an internship where I can contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals- got any leads? Let me know!

ðŸ›  Tech Stack:

Languages: Python, Java
Data Science: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow
Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, GitHub
Databases: SQL, MySQL

ðŸš€ Projects:

Here are some projects that Iâ€™ve worked on:

1. AI Studio project in Breakthrough Tech AI
Predict electricity demand in Texas. Developing a machine learning model based on regression trees and using Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain the decisions made by these regression trees. 
Tech Stack: Python, VSCode
Learnings: Clean data, build model and deal with time-seies data, prompt engineering

2. An AI-Driven Approach to System Reliability Analysis
Processed and analyzed unstructured text using NLP techniques, including tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization.
Implemented and evaluated clustering algorithms (K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and built predictive models with Support Vector Machines (SVM). Leveraged cosine similarity and knowledge graphs to develop a recommendation system that suggests actions based on input descriptions.
Tech Stack: Python, VSCode
Learnings: Processing unstructured data

3. Statistical Analysis
Clean and organize data, performing statistical analyses like Shapiro-test, T-test, Mann-Whitney-test and survival analysis to investigate the relationship between Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) metrics and adverse clinical events.
Tech Stack: Python, VSCode, R
Learnings: Clean data, conducting all kinds of statistical tests
